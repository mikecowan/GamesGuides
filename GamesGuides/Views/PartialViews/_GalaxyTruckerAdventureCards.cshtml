<h3>Adventure Cards</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Aliens count as crew for adventure cards</li>
    <li>Aliens do <i>not</i> contribute +2 engine/cannon strength if strength is 0 without them</li>
    <li>Cards get discarded to the box after flights, do not shuffle back into their deck</li>
    <li>Generally all decisions are made in <i>forward</i> order, and ships lose flight days in <i>reverse</i> ship order</li>
    <li>When loading new goods, you can re-arrange or discard any cargo.</li>
    <li>When losing goods, always give up the most valuable goods. Give up battery tokens if not enough to goods to give up.</li>
