@*    ***
    these rules were written under the assumption of base game (3 parties) but only using 2-parties
    ergo, we can extend this to the general situation of using the playmat (4 parties) but using less than 4 parties
    1. do not place counters in the groove of any party not in play. instead, place counters of states with a primary tiebreaker of an unused party in the groove of the in-play party matching the highest tiebreaker.
    2. do not place any voters for a party that is not in play. instead, in states with a first tiebreaker of an unused party, place _one_ voter of the party matching the second tiebreaker ... unless the second tiebreaker party is also not in play. in that case, place _one_ voter of the party matching the third tiebreaker

    assume a state uses tiebreaker ordering RBG
